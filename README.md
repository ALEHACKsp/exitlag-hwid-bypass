Do u wanna create more than one trial account on exitlag? This 'spoofer' is for you!

## How to use?
- Compile (or download the released one) and execute this program. Then execute ExitLag.
- Login with a new account (create one with a tempemail, such has <a href="https://www.developermail.com/mail/">this one</a>).
- You gonna see that there are 3 days of trial.
Yes, u need to do this with every new account.
    
## How it works?
  - We hook some place in the assembly before it send the login request
  - Then we change the HWID to some other (rand letters)
  When the request is made to the server, the server will think it is a new pc
  and will give 3 days of trial.		

### This may help you

 - I made a <a href="https://greasyfork.org/pt-BR/scripts/420383-automatic-create-account-exitlag">greasyfork script</a> to automatic fill the fields of email and password. 
 - So, with one click you can create a new account.
 - I just didn't make a thing to create tons of accounts because they have a google captcha.
